Usage
=======

Rely on the **"MPChartExample"** folder and check out the examples in that project. The example project is also  [**available in the Google PlayStore**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xxmassdeveloper.mpchartexample). 

Furthermore, here is some code to get started.

**Setup:**

For using a <code>LineChart, BarChart, ScatterChart or PieChart </code>, define it in .xml:
```xml
    <com.github.mikephil.charting.charts.LineChart
        android:id="@+id/chart"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent" />
``` 
```java
    LineChart chart = (LineChart) findViewById(R.id.chart);
``` 

or create it in code (and then **add it to a layout**):
```java
    LineChart chart = new LineChart(Context);
```   

**Styling:**

 - <code>setDescription(String desc)</code>: Set a description text that appears in the bottom right corner of the chart.
 - <code>setDescriptionTypeface(Typeface t)</code>: Sets the <code>Typeface</code> used for drawing the description text.
 - <code>setGraphOffsets(int left, int right, int top, int bottom)</code>: Sets the offsets of the graph in every direction, provide density pixels.
 - <code>setDrawYValues(boolean enabled)</code>: If set to true, the actual drawn values will be drawn next to the points, bars, or pie slices of the chart.
 - <code>setValuePaintColor(int color)</code>: Sets the color used for drawing the values if <code>setDrawYValues(...)</code> is enabled.
 - <code>setValueTypeface(Typeface t)</code>: Sets the <code>Typeface</code> used for drawing the values if <code>setDrawYValues(...)</code> is enabled.
 - <code>setValueDigits(int digits)</code>: Sets the number of digits to use for all printed values.
 - <code>setPaint(Paint p, int which)</code>: Replaces the specified default <code>Paint</code> object with a new one. This method can be used to replace any predefined <code>Paint</code> object with an own <code>Paint</code> object and develop a completely personalized design.

**Getters and convenience:**
- <code>public ChartData getDataCurrent()</code>: Returns the <code>ChartData</code> object the chart currently displays. It contains all information concerning the displayed values such as minimum and maximum values, value counts, value sums, ...
- <code>public float getScaleX()</code>: Returns the current scale factor on the x-axis.
- <code>public float getYChartMin()</code>: Returns the current minimum y-value that can be displayed by the chart - bottom line.
- <code>public float getYChartMax()</code>: Returns the current maximum y-value that can be displayed by the chart - top line.
- <code>public float getAverage()</code>: Returns the average value across all values the chart holds.
- <code>public float getAverage(int type)</code>: Returns the average value for a specific DataSet type in the chart. This type is the type provided in the <code>DataSet</code> constructor.
- <code>public PointF getCenter()</code>: Returns the center point of the chart in pixels.

 
**Gestures & Selecting:**

 - <code>setTouchEnabled(boolean enabled)</code>: If set to ture, touch gestures (such as scaling and dragging) will be possible on the chart. NOTE: If touch-gestures are disabled, highlighting on touch is disabled as well. Default: true.
 - <code>setOnChartValueSelectedListener(OnChartValueSelectedListener l)</code>: Sets a selection-listener to the chart that will generate callbacks when values are selected or unselected. The callback contains the selected values and their indices.
 - <code>setHighlightEnabled(boolean enabled)</code>: If set to true, highlighting/selecting values is possible on the chart. Default: true.
 
**Other:**
 - <code>saveToGallery(String title)</code>: Saves the current chart state as an image to the gallery.
 - <code>saveToPath(String title, String pathOnSD)</code>: Saves the current chart state as an image to the specified path.
 - <code>setScaleMinima(float x, float y)</code>: Sets the minimum scale factors for x- and y-axis. If set for example to 3f, the user will not be able to fully zoom out.
 - <code>centerViewPort(int xIndex, float val)</code>: This method makes it possible to aim the center of the view (what you can see from the chart) to a specific position inside the chart, described by the index on the x-axis and the value on the y-axis. This also works very well in combination with the `setScaleMinima(...)` method.

**Adding data:**

If you want to add values (data) to the chart, it has to be done via the 

```java
    setData(ChartData data);
```
method. The baseclass <code>ChartData</code> class encapsulates all data and information that is needed for the chart during rendering. For each type of chart, a different subclass of `ChartData` (e.g. `LineData`) exists that should be used for setting data for the chart. In the constructor, you can hand over an <code>ArrayList<? extends DataSet></code> as the values to display, and an additional <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>String</code> that will describe the labels on the x-axis. Example with the class `LineData` (extends `ChartData`), which is used for adding data to a `LineChart`:

```java
    public LineData(ArrayList<String> xVals, ArrayList<LineDataSet> sets) { ... }
```

So, what is a <code>DataSet</code> and why do you need it? That is actually pretty simple. One <code>DataSet</code> object represents a group of entries (datatype <code>Entry</code>) inside the chart that belong together. It is designed to **logically separate different groups of values in the chart**. For each type of chart, a differnt object that extends `DataSet` (e.g. `LineDataSet`) exists that allows specific styling. 

As an example, you might want to display the quarterly revenue of two different companies over one year in a `LineChart`. In that case, it would be recommended to create two different <code>LineDataSet</code> objects, each containing four values (one for each quarter). As an <code>ArrayList<String></code> to describe the labels on the x-axis, you would simply provide the four Strings "1.Q", "2.Q", "3.Q", "4.Q".

Of course, it is also possible to provide just one <code>LineDataSet</code> object containing all 8 values for the two companys. 

So how to setup a <code>LineDataSet</code> object?
```java
    public LineDataSet(ArrayList<Entry> yVals, String label) { ... }
```

When looking at the constructor, it is visible that the <code>LineDataSet</code> needs an <code>ArrayList</code> of type <code>Entry</code> and a `String` used to describe the `LineDataSet` and as a label used for the `Legend`. Furthermore this label can be used to find the `LineDataSet` amongst other `LineDataSet` objects in the `LineData` object.

The <code>ArrayList</code> of type <code>Entry</code> encapsulates all values of the chart. A <code>Entry</code> object is an additional wrapper around a value and holds the value itself, and it's position on the x-axis (the index inside the <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>String</code> of the <code>LineData</code> object the value is mapped to):
```java
    public Entry(float val, int xIndex) { ... }
```

Putting it all together (example of two companies with quarterly revenue over one year):

At first, create the lists of type <code>Entry</code> that will hold your values:

```java
    ArrayList<Entry> valsComp1 = new ArrayList<Entry>();
    ArrayList<Entry> valsComp2 = new ArrayList<Entry>();
```
Then, fill the lists with <code>Entry</code> objects. Make sure the entry objects contain the correct indices to the x-axis. (of course, a loop can be used here, in that case, the counter variable of the loop could be the index on the x-axis).

```java
    Entry c1e1 = new Entry(100.000f, 0); // 0 == quarter 1
    valsComp1.add(c1e1);
    Entry c1e2 = new Entry(50.000f, 1; // 1 == quarter 2 ...
    valsComp1.add(c1e2);
    // and so on ...
    
    Entry c2e1 = new Entry(120.000f, 0); // 0 == quarter 1
    valsComp2.add(c2e1);
    Entry c2e2 = new Entry(110.000f, 1; // 1 == quarter 2 ...
    valsComp2.add(c2e2);
    //...
```

Now that we have our lists of <code>Entry</code> objects, the <code>LineDataSet</code> objects can be created:
```java
    LineDataSet setComp1 = new LineDataSet(valsComp1, "Company 1");
    LineDataSet setComp2 = new LineDataSet(valsComp2, "Company 2");
```
Last but not least, we create a list of <code>DataSets</code> and a list of x legend entries and build our <code>ChartData</code> object:

```java
    ArrayList<LineDataSet> dataSets = new ArrayList<LineDataSet>();
    dataSets.add(setComp1);
    dataSets.add(setComp2);
    
    ArrayList<String> xVals = new ArrayList<String>();
    xVals.add("1.Q"); xVals.add("2.Q"); xVals.add("3.Q"); xVals.add("4.Q"); 
    
    LineData data = new LineData(xVals, dataSets);
    mLineChart.setData(data);
```

**Setting colors:**

Since release [v1.4.0](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/releases/tag/v1.4.0), the `ColorTemplate` object that was responsible for setting colors in previous releases is no longer needed. Nevertheless, it still holds all predefined color arrays (e.g. `ColorTemplate.VORDIPLOM_COLORS` and provides convenience methods for transforming colors from the resources (resource integers) into "real" colors.

Instead of the `ColorTemplate`, colors can now be specified directly via `DataSet` object, which allows separate styling for each `DataSet`.

In this short example, we have our two different `LineDataSet` objects representing the quarterly revenues of two companies (previously mentioned in the **Adding data** tutorial), for which we now want to set different colors.

What we want:

 - the values of "Company 1" should be represented by four different variations of the color "red"
 - the values of "Company 2" should be represented by four different variations of the color "green"

This is what the code looks like:

```java
  LineDataSet setComp1 = new LineDataSet(valsComp1, "Company 1");
  
  // sets colors for the dataset, resolution of the resource name to a "real" color is done internally
  setComp1.setColors(new int[] { R.color.red1, R.color.red2, R.color.red3, R.color.red4 }, Context);
  
  LineDataSet setComp2 = new LineDataSet(valsComp2, "Company 2");
  setComp2.setColors(new int[] { R.color.green1, R.color.green2, R.color.green3, R.color.green4 }, Context);
```

Besides that, there are many other ways for setting colors for a `DataSet`. Here is the full documentation:

 - `setColors(int [] colors, Context c)`: Sets the colors that should be used fore this DataSet. Colors are reused as soon as the number of Entries the DataSet represents is higher than the size of the colors array. You can use "new int[] { R.color.red, R.color.green, ... }" to provide colors for this method. Internally, the colors are resolved using getResources().getColor(...).
 - `setColors(int [] colors)`: Sets the colors that should be used fore this DataSet. Colors are reused as soon as the number of Entries the DataSet represents is higher than the size of the colors array. Make sure that the colors are already prepared (by calling getResources().getColor(...)) before adding them to the DataSet.
 - `setColors(ArrayList<Integer> colors)`: Sets the colors that should be used fore this DataSet. Colors are reused as soon as the number of Entries the DataSet represents is higher than the size of the colors array. Make sure that the colors are already prepared (by calling getResources().getColor(...)) before adding them to the DataSet.
 - `setColor(int color)`: Sets the one and ONLY color that should be used for this DataSet. Internally, this recreates the colors array and adds the specified color.

`ColorTemplate` example:

```java
LineDataSet set = new LineDataSet(...);
set.setColors(ColorTemplate.VORDIPLOM_COLORS, Context);

// or:
set.setColors(ColorTemplate.createColors(ColorTemplate.VORDIPLOM_COLORS));
```

If no colors are set for a `DataSet`, default colors are used.


**Displaying / styling legends:**

By default, all chart types support legends and will automatically generate and draw a legend after setting data for the chart. If a legend should be drawn or not can be enabled/disabled using the

 - `setDrawLegend(boolean enabled)`
 
method.

The number of entries the automatically generated legend contains depends on the number of different colors (across all `DataSet` objects) as well as on the `DataSet` labels. The labels of the `Legend` depend on the labels set for the used `DataSet` objects in the chart. If no labels for the `DataSet` objects have been specified, the chart will automatically generate them. If multiple colors are used for one `DataSet`, those colors are grouped and only described by one label.

For customizing the `Legend`, use you can retreive the `Legend` object from the chart **after setting data** using the `getLegend()` method.

```java
    // setting data...
    chart.setData(....);
    
    Legend l = chart.getLegend();
    l.setFormSize(10f); // set the size of the legend forms/shapes
    l.setForm(LegendForm.CIRCLE); // set what type of form/shape should be used
    l.setPosition(LegendPosition.BELOW_CHART_LEFT);
    l.setTypeface(...);
    l.setXEntrySpace(5f); // set the space between the legend entries on the x-axis
    l.setYEntrySpace(5f); // set the space between the legend entries on the y-axis
    // and many more...
```


**Displaying / styling labels:**

Labels (classes `XLabel` and `YLabel`) are used to describe the values of the chart on the x- and y-axis. While the x-axis labels display what is handed over to the `ChartData` object as an `ArrayList<String>` ("xVals"), the y-axis labels depend on the actual values that are set for the chart.

Labels can be enabled/disabled, using the methods:

 - `setDrawXLabels(boolean enabled)`
 - `setDrawYLabels(boolean enabled)`

the chart provides.
In order to apply a different styling to the labels, the methods `getYLabels()` and `getXLabels()` can be used to acquire the labels object and modify it.

Example:

```java
XLabels xl = mChart.getXLabels();
xl.setPosition(XLabelPosition.BOTTOM); // set the position
xl.setTypeface(...); // set a different font
xl.setTextSize(12f); // set the textsize
xl.setSpaceBetweenLabels(3); // set how many characters of space should be between the labels
//... and more

YLabels yl = mChart.getYLabels();
yl.setPosition(YLabelPosition.BOTH_SIDED); // set the position
yl.setTypeface(...); // set a different font
yl.setTextSize(12f); // set the textsize
yl.setLabelCount(6); // set how many label entries should be displayed
//... and more

```

**Limit Lines:**

Limit lines (class `LimitLine`) are (as the name might indicate) plain and simple lines that can be set for all `Line-, Bar- and ScatterData` objects. They can be used to **provide additional information** for the user. 

As an example, your chart might display various blood pressure measurement results the user logged with an application. In order to inform the user that a systolic blood pressure of over 140 mmHg is considered to be a health risk, you could add a `LimitLine` at 140 to provide that information.

```java

LineData ld = new LineData(...);

LimitLine ll = new LimitLine(140f);
ll.setLineColor(Color.RED);
ll.setLineWidth(4f);
// .. and more styling options

ld.addLimitLine(ll);
```

**Animations:**

All chart types support animations that can be used to create / build up the chart in an awesome looking way. Three different kinds of animation methods exist that animate either both, or x- and y-axis separately:

 - `animateX(int durationMillis)`: Animates the charts values on the horizontal axis, meaning that the chart will build up within the specified time from left to right.
 - `animateY(int durationMillis)`: Animates the charts values on the vertical axis, meaning that the chart will build up within the specified time from bottom to top.
 - `animateXY(int xDuration, int yDuration)`: Animates both horizontal and vertical axis, resulting in a left/right bottom/top build-up.

```java
mChart.animateX(3000f); // animate horizontal 3000 milliseconds
// or:
mChart.animateY(3000f); // animate vertical 3000 milliseconds
// or:
mChart.animateXY(3000f, 3000f); // animate horizontal and vertical 3000 milliseconds
```

If `animate(...)` (of any kind) is called, no further calling of `invalidate()` is necessary to refresh the chart.

In order to support animations below Honeycomb, this library makes use of the awesome [**nineoldandroids library**](https://github.com/JakeWharton/NineOldAndroids) developed by Jake Wharton.

More documentation and example code coming soon.
